# Animal Shelter Program

# Scenario

A local animalshelter needs an application to manage their pet actions & tasks. 
The application will allow for workers to check-in new animals as well as adopt them out, edit the animal information, 
schedule events such as cleanings or vet check-ups, and search for animals by collar ID or species. 
It should also track the time the animals have been in the shelter. 
Animalsâ€™information should include the main species & sub-species.
